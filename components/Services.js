            You may be led to therapy by anxiety, depression, relationship stress,

            your stress, you don't have to face it alone. Therapy offers you the time
            and space to work toward wellness and peace.

              The care you provide for others may be driving you to seek therapy,
              whether due to burnout, compassion fatigue, imposter syndrome,
              people-pleasing tendencies, or perfectionism. Whether you're in
              pre-professional school, undergoing training, or reflecting on a
              long career in healthcare, we can address the unique stressors of
              your professional environment along with any challenges you may
              be facing in other areas of your life.

              Life's challenges, whether a difficult childhood, a traumatic event

              Therapy offers a supportive space to process these experiences,
              care for yourself amidst painful thoughts and emotions, and work
              toward a sense of grounding and meaning.

              Second-generation individuals in immigrant families, born in the
              U.S. to at least one parent born abroad, often navigate the
              complexities of multiple cultures and diverse expectations. This
              experience can bring challenges such as feeling like a foreigner
              in your own country and navigating strained family relationships.
              Therapy offers a supportive space to explore and process this
              unique aspect of your identity.
