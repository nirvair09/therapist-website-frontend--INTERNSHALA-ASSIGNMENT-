          </h1>

            Finding time and opportunities to care for ourselves can be incredibly challenging in today's busy and demanding world. I believe therapy offers a dedicated space for self-care, providing the support and tools needed to improve this essential practice. Therapy can help individuals identify and clarify their goals, values, and the various elements that contribute to their well-being, recognizing that these aspects vary from person to person.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            I am dedicated to supporting this journey by offering active listening, psychological knowledge, empathy, compassion, and insights into behavioral patterns and tendencies. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Clinical Psychology from the Michigan School of Psychology (2012) and a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from Western Michigan University (2018). My experience spans therapy and psychological assessment in psychiatric inpatient units, academic medical centers, universities, and outpatient practice settings.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
            My therapeutic approach is primarily psychodynamic and humanistic, enriched by influences from positive psychology, existentialism, family systems theory, acceptance and commitment concepts, and mindfulness practices.
